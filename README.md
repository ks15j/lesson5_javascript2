### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Functions in JavaScript: 
A function in JavaScript is code used to preform a task.
A function can be invoked by using a function call. The syntax for a function uses
the function keyword, along with the function name, then followed with
parentheses. Inside these parentheses, may contain parameter names, which will 
correspond with variables declared in the JavaScript function. Code to be executed
may be placed within the brackets. This code will be execued every time the function
is called.
2. JavaScript Objects: 
Objects in java are like variables, however, objects can contain many values. 
Values in an object are written as name: value pairs. You can define an object in 
Javascript by using a var keyword defining the object name, and then inserting key:
value pairs within curly brackets. 
3. JavaScript Function Scope:
In JavaScript there are two types of scope: local scope and global scope. When a function
is made, it creates a new scope. This means that variables declared inside the function are 
not accessible from outside that function. This means that variable declared inside the 
function are local to that function. A variable declared outside of this function, however, 
has global scope, which means its accessible to all scripts and functions
within the program.
